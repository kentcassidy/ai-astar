# ai-astar
This project was completed by myself for my artificial intelligence class assignment.
The skeleton code (function declarations without definition) for astar.py and tiles.py, as well as the entirety of test.py were provided to me by the instructor.

In this assignment, I implemented the A* search algorithm to solve a 15-puzzle (4x4 sliding tile puzzle with one empty space).
My solution implements a Manhattan distance-based heuristic to extend Dijkstra's algorithm. This solution spans the creation and traversal of a state tree, where the root node represents the game's starting state
and each edge represents a single possible action from the parent state.

The A* search, though simply a type of greedy algorithm + a heuristic, is known for its efficiency in a range of modern applications including GPS and network routing as well as natural language processing (NLP).
This project displays my ability to implement an essential algorithm into code, and my understanding of game tree conceptualization and traversal (+ queues and other data structures).
